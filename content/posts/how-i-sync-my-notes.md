# A guide to syncing your notes or files across different devices using Obsidian.

<!--more-->
### 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your devices:
- Obsidian (for note-taking)
- Git (for version control and syncing)
- iSH Shell (for Git on iOS) 
- termux (for Git on Android)

### 2. Why I Chose This Method
Initially, I used VS Code and Markdown for note-taking. Over time, I explored alternatives like Notion and Standard Notes, but they didn’t suit my workflow. Eventually, I switched to Obsidian—a simple and efficient choice.

However, I didn't want to pay for Obsidian Sync. Instead, I set up Git-based syncing for my notes, and I realized others might find this approach useful too.

### 3. Getting Started
#### Step 1: Install Obsidian
Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) based on your operating system:

Desktop:
- Windows 
- Mac 
- Linux:

  - Snap [ I installed via snap ;) ]

  - Flatpak
