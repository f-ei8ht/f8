## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have below listed things installed on your system.

- GCC (g++ for cpp)
- They are required to build and compile cpp programs.

## Install Sublime Text

Next you must install sublime text from their [official website](https://www.sublimetext.com).

### Setup for linux

I use 4189 build of sublime on arch by the way, you can download which one is latest.

Follow the steps on this [page](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html#pacman).

After downloading sublime text, download linter for c++ on sublime.
- SublimeLinter
- SublimeLinter-gcc 
- Make sure you have package control installed already.
