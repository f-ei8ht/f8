## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have below listed things installed on your system.

- GCC(g++ for cpp)
- They are required to build and compile cpp programs.

## Install Sublime Text

Next you must install sublime text from their [official website](https://www.sublimetext.com).

### Setup for linux

I use **arch** by the way, so I will tell you how to setup for arch based distro's.

I use 4189 build of sublime, you can download that as it is latest.
Hi there.
