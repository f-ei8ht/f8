Hello there 👋. I’m **Saif**.

On this site:

1. I will share my journey as a developer and problem solver.
2. Document my projects and technical explorations.


My Technical Interests:

- Open Source

  - [Pull Request 3](https://github.com/mehmetemineker/flappy-bird/pull/5/files) - I closed this request for some reason.

A Bit More About Me:

- I’m a 21-year-old from **India 🇮🇳**, passionate about coding, math, and continuous learning. Currently, I’m focused on landing a tech role.

- If you’re wondering about my alias, **f8**, it comes from my fascination with function keys—F8 just stood out! 

- And as for **d/dx f8 = saif**, it gives off a cool math-meets-tech vibe, like taking the derivative of something abstract.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing games like:

- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Ghost Recon: Breakpoint 
- Or enjoying a game of cricket 🏏.
- I had played a lot of games over the years, including:
  - GTA Series (San Andreas, Vice City, 3, 4, 5)
  - Prince of Persia series
  - IGI 2, Max Payne (all parts)
  - God of War (up to God of War 3)
  - Call of Duty: Black Ops
  - Hollow Knight, Among Us
  - Metro Exodus, and many more!
- Currently I'm playing **RDR2**

I'm also into sports, especially **cricket** 🏏. Here are some of my achievements:

- 🥉 Bronze in Javelin (School)
- 🥇 Gold in Discus (School)
- 🥈 Silver in Javelin (Twice in College)
