Hello there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Saif, and I like to code in java and c++.
Apart from coding, I love exploring mathematical concepts. 
I also dedicate time to self-improvement, focusing on communication and staying updated with the latest trends in technology.

Currently, Iâ€™m on a mission to land an exciting role in tech, dedicating 11-12 hours daily to upskilling and preparing for the professional world.

### Why the name f8?
- I was trying to find a good alias name for me, one day the function keys caught my attention and I liked the f8 key, so I put the name f8 on work.
