Hello there ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m **Saif**.

On this site:

1. I will share my journey as a developer and problem solver.
2. Document my projects and technical explorations.


My Technical Interests:

- Linux - arch btw&nbsp; <div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="../images/archlinux.svg" width=16></div>
- Backend development
- Algorithms
- Mathematics & little bit of physics
- Open Source
  - [Pull Request 1](https://github.com/mehmetemineker/flappy-bird/pull/4/files)
  - [Pull Request 2](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/PicturePuzzle/pull/1/commits/8e896d48592e348fd84c139a3de88373d03c0e71)
  - [Pull Request 3](https://github.com/mehmetemineker/flappy-bird/pull/5/files) - I closed this request for some reason.

A Bit More About Me:

- Iâ€™m a 21-year-old from **India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³**, passionate about coding, math, and continuous learning. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on landing a tech role.
- If youâ€™re wondering about my alias, **f8**, it comes from my fascination with function keysâ€”F8 just stood out! 
- And as for **d/dx f8 = saif**, it gives off a cool math-meets-tech vibe, like taking the derivative of something abstract.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me playing games like:

- Red Dead Redemption 
- Ghost Recon: Breakpoint 
- Or enjoying a game of cricket.
- I had played a lot of games over the years, including:
  - GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, GTA 3, GTA 4, GTA 5
  - Prince of Persia series
  - IGI 2, Max Payne (all parts)
  - God of War (up to God of War 3)
  - Call of Duty: Black Ops
  - Hollow Knight, Among Us
  - Metro Exodus, and many more!
